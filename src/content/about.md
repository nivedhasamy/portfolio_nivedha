I am **Nivedha**, a self-taught **Front-end developer** based in Chennai, **India**.<br>
I enjoy converting designs to beautiful and responsive web applications.<br>
As I started reading N-number of articles on a journey to learn React.Js and Redux I realised I have a lot to share too, hence, started writing **blogs** on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@nivedhasamy)**.<br>
Interested in knowing what I have been working on? Take a ride to my **[portfolio](#portfolio)**.

Iâ€™m _hard working_, _passionate_, _committed_, and a _fast learner_!

**My current stack of languages/technologies:**<br>
HTML5 - JavaScript - CSS3 - Sass - ReactJs - Redux Toolkit - Redux-Saga - Styled Components - Gatsby
<br>

**Because resumes are old-fashioned:**<br>
You can checkout my **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nivedhaduraisamy/)** page to get to know my detailed work experience.<br>

Let's grab a coffee and **[talk](#contact)** to build something fun.
